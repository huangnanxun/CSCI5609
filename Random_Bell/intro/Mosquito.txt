Mosquitoes (alternate spelling mosquitos) are a group of about 3500 species of small insects that are a type of fly (order Diptera).Mosquitoes have a slender segmented body, a pair of wings, three pairs of long hair-like legs, feathery antennae, and elongated mouthparts. Females of most species have tube-like mouthparts (called a proboscis) which can pierce the skin of the host  in order to extract blood, which contains protein and iron needed to produce eggs.The saliva of the mosquito transmitted to the host with the bite can cause itching and a rash.
