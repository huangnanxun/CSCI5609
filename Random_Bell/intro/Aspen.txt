Aspen is a common name for certain tree species; some, but not all, are classified by botanists in the section Populus, of the Populus genus.The aspens are all native to cold regions with cool summers, in the north of the Northern Hemisphere, extending south at high-altitude areas such as mountains or high plains. Aspens typically grow in environments that are otherwise dominated by coniferous tree species, and which are often lacking other large deciduous tree species.
